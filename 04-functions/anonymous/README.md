# Anonymous Functions

Go supports anonymous functions, which can form closures. Anonymous functions are useful when you want to define a function inline without naming it.

## Features Demonstrated

1.  **Variable Assignment**: You can assign a function to a variable: `plus := func(a, b int) int { ... }`.
2.  **Immediate Execution**: You can define and call a function at the same time: `func() { ... }()`.
